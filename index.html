      What is this thing !!?<br>
      well this is a zero player game called 'game of life'.<br>
      It is a simulation that shows how a simple set of rules and fixed starting choices can create a complex and chaotic
      system.<br>
      Why am i discussing about this game ?</br>
      life is just like that, complex and chaotic.every small things happend in our lifes have contributed to how we are now.
      <br>
      Similarly small small incidents in my life lead me to be facinted by science,engineering and developer(trying to be).<br>
      Love for science and engineering led me through fairly stright forward educational path.<br>
      After school education, i accuired a bachelores degree in applied electronics and instrumentation with fairly good scores.<br>
      Then completed my Masters degree in same field.
