      Hello there,</br>

      You are catching the sight of boids steering around, trying to escape the predators' grasp.
      Such a fascinating artificial life simulation!!</br>
      Why are you welcomed with the glimpse of some bird-like objects flying all over the place?</br>
      The answer is ...</br>
      </br>
      Meet me, Visakh.</br>
      I believe that there is a science behind any action and situation. 
      'Science is reasoning' and it holds so much power,I dared to unleash them when I decided to 
      pursue B,Tech in Applied electronics and instrumentation(quite a momentous ride)
      Then what? they said why not get a master's in the same discipline, that would be cool!
      So here I am, self-established engineer and a full-time IT guy(though developer sounds more sophisticated).
      </br>
      </br>
      Would you like to have a look at my work? then 'Click'!!
